## Research Premise

Official happiness rankings rely on self-reported survey data where social desirability bias influences responses. This study analyzes the gap between OECD wellbeing scores and Google Trends search behavior for mental health distress signals across 16 countries.

**Core Hypothesis:** Countries with large gaps between official happiness scores and nighttime distress searches may indicate either cultural pressure to report positivity, successful mental health awareness campaigns, or different search behaviors.

## Core Findings

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Largest Gap** | 5.3 points (Finland) | Official happiness (7.8/10) vs behavioral distress signals |
| **Facade Countries** | 9 nations | Gap exceeds 3.0 points between claimed and observed wellbeing |
| **Highest Distress** | 72.8 (Mexico) | Normalized search intensity for mental health terms |
| **Authentic Countries** | 3 nations | Gap < 2.0 points, indicating alignment |
| **Countries Analyzed** | 16 | Global coverage with complete datasets |
| **Data Points** | 1,200+ | 12-month behavioral observation period |
